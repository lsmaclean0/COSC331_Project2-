# COSC331_Project2-\
All work on this project was done use an ubuntu 16.04 virtual machine running 
on Oracle VirtualBox 5.2.8
Look under Folder P2, you should see folders
    * contacts: if you open a terminal and type '''npm start''' it will open the react application app.js
        * this foler contains an attempt (possibly several) at creating a react front end to communicate with the 
        express back end. Apparently you have to use a proxy to get them to communicate but that didnt seem to make a                   difference. Every POST, PUT, GET, call still returned undefined. 
    * src: contains the same source files from the rest api from class
    * server.js: this was my attempt at creating an express app for the back end 
    
Other attemps are in separate folders
